# starkow.dev

sources of my [starkow.dev](https://starkow.dev) website.

you will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

this repository only contains the sources of the website, not the backend, so the spotify and letterbox parts probably won't work. i will probably opensource the backend in the future.

## installing

##### npm

```sh
npm install
```

##### yarn

```sh
yarn
```

## running

##### npm

```sh
npm run dev
```

##### yarn

```sh
yarn dev
```

## building

##### npm

```sh
npm run build
```

##### yarn

```sh
yarn build
```

all the necessary files will be generated in the `dist` folder.
